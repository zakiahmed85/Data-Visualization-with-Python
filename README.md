# 📊 Data Visualization with Python

A comprehensive guide and collection of projects focused on data analysis and creating compelling visualizations using Python libraries.

## 🚀 Project Overview

This repository serves as a portfolio of various data visualization techniques using different Python tools. The goal is to explore datasets and present insights through visually appealing charts and graphs.

The main notebook for this project is `Data_Visualization_with_Python.ipynb`.

### Key Features
*   **Interactive Visualizations:** Utilizing libraries like Plotly or Bokeh for dynamic charts (if applicable).
*   **Static Plots:** Examples using `Matplotlib` and `Seaborn`.
*   **Data Analysis:** Demonstrates data cleaning and exploratory data analysis (EDA) techniques.
*   **Structured Code:** Code is organized for clarity and easy navigation.

## 🛠️ Technologies & Tools

This project uses the following languages and libraries:
*  **Python**
*  **Pandas:** For data manipulation and analysis.
*  **NumPy:** For numerical operations.
*  **Matplotlib & Seaborn:** For creating static visualizations.
*  **Plotly:** For creating interactive, web-based charts and graphs.
*  **Dash:** A Python framework built on Flask and Plotly, used for building analytical web applications/dashboards.
*  **Jupyter Notebook:** The primary environment for the analysis and visualization.
